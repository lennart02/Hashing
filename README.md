# Hash Function Demonstrator

## Project Overview

This C# application demonstrates the functionality and performance of various hash functions. It's designed as a learning tool for understanding how different hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, and a simple additive hash process input data to produce fixed-size outputs. The project focuses on showcasing the basic properties of these hash functions, including their security aspects and performance metrics.

## Features

- **Multiple Hash Functions:** Support for MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, and a basic additive hash function.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate the time and computational resources required by each hashing algorithm.
- **Security Discussion:** Overview of the cryptographic strength and vulnerabilities associated with each hash function.
- **Interactive Testing:** Users can input their own data and get a hash output of all implemented Hash Functions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (version 8.0 or higher recommended)
- An IDE that supports C# (Visual Studio, VSCode, etc.)

## Usage

Follow the on-screen prompts to input text. The application will display the resulting hashes and performance data for all implemented hashing algorithms.
