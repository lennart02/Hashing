# Hash Function Demonstration

This repository is created for educational purposes, showcasing experiments with hash functions in C#.

## Project Overview

The repository includes the following projects:

### Hashing
A simple implementation of Multiplication Hashing and Division Hashing.

### HashTable
A comprehensive implementation of a Hashtable using Division Hashing, including insert, delete, and search operations. Examples of Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing, and Double Hashing are provided. It also comes with dynamic resizing through rehashing.

### Cryptographic Hashing
This C# application demonstrates the functionality and performance of various cryptographic hash functions, such as MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512. Additionally, I added a simple additive hash, that processes input data to produce fixed-size outputs. 


|           | MD5 | SHA1 | SHA256 | SHA512 | Simple Hash |
|-----------|-----|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Bit Size  | 128 | 160  | 256    | 512    | 16          |



### Tests
Includes various tests for the hash functions and hash table implementations.

### Docs
A collection of [Drawio](https://draw.io) diagrams is stored here.

## Usage
These projects demonstrate basic hashing concepts. They can be executed directly. It is recommended to modify `Program.cs` to test different examples and gain a deeper understanding.
