# Hash Function Demonstration

This repository is made for educational purposes. I tested and played with Hash functions in different programming languages.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following examples:
####  Cryptographic Hashing

This C# application demonstrates the functionality and performance of various hash functions. It's designed as a learning tool for understanding how different hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, and a simple additive hash process input data to produce fixed-size outputs. The project focuses on showcasing the basic properties of these hash functions, including their security aspects and performance metrics.

#### Python
Here is one example of two different images, that have the same image. This shows how collission can occur on completely different data.


## Usage

Follow the on-screen prompts to input text. The application will display the resulting hashes and performance data for all implemented hashing algorithms.
